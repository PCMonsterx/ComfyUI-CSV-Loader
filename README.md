NO LONGER BEING SUPPORTED BY MYSELF AS I DO NOT CURRENTLY HAVE THE TIME. CHECK OUT DR.LATA NODES FOR A SIMILAR WOROING NODE WHERE MY STYLE CSV WAS INCORPORATED. ALSO CHECK OUT THE FORKED PROJECTS.

# ComfyUI-CSV-Loader
CSV Loader for prompt building within ComfyUI interface.

Allows access to positive/negative prompts associated with a name. Selections are being pulled from CSV files.

CSV Loader for basic image composition. Unzip the ComfyUI-CSV-Loader.zip file and place it into the custom_nodes folder within your ComfyUI installation. Do not change the naming so the mapping for the CSV files stay consistent.

Within the folder you will find a ComyUI_Simple_Workflow.png you can drag into ComfyUI to test the nodes are working or add them to your current workflow to try them out.

The folder with the CSV files is located in the ComfyUI\custom_nodes\ComfyUI-CSV_Loader\CSV folder to keep everything contained. 
The CSV files include artists.csv, artmovements.csv, characters.csv, composition.csv, lighting.csv, negative.csv, positive.csv, settings.csv,
and styles.csv.
All have some preloaded selections but can always be updated in the CSV files.
